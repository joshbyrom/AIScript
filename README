AIScript
====================================

I created this project to act as a framework to easily implement my projects using JavaScript.

Scene Graph
------------------

My projects will be using the processing.js library for rendering. More info can be found at: http://processingjs.org/


Information & Usage
------------------

Samples of how to use this project and descriptions of the objects within are coming soon!


External Resources Required
------------------

As mentioned processing.js is used as the scene graph for the framework, but this can be easily changed.

Until a build process if created, your page will need to include the modules you will be using from the AIScript library as well as the processing.js file if you choose to use it.

For example, the very first simulation I created used the Space, Entity, and Simulations modules and was started like this:

addEvent(window, 'load', function () {
    AIScript('Space', 'Entities', 'Simulations', function (box) {
	// Space, Entity, and Simulations are included in the box object
        var e = new box.Entities.Entity(0, 0, 1, 2);	// this was just for testing

        this.simulate(new box.Simulations.LineTestSimulation());
        this.start();
    });
});

This is commonly referred to as sandboxing.


Notes
------------------

This project is a work in progress and some commit pushes may even break its functionality completely! 

Samples of simulations running inside this framework will occasionally appear on my site at: joshbyrom.com
