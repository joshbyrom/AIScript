AIScript
====================================

A framework that can be used to easily implement AI projects using JavaScript. The views are available through an HTML5 Canvas element using the processing.js library. The project interfaces with processing using pure Javascript, but adding your own PDE files would be an trivial addition. Several simulations are provided to illustrate how to use the scripts. A build process will be designed in the future to package and minify the scripts into a single script for ease-of-use.

Scene Graph
------------------

My projects will be using the processing.js library for rendering. More info can be found at: http://processingjs.org/


Information & Usage
------------------

Samples of how to use this project and descriptions of the objects within are coming soon!


External Resources Required
------------------

As mentioned processing.js is used as the scene graph for the framework, but this can be easily changed.

Until a build process if created, your page will need to include the modules you will be using from the AIScript library as well as the processing.js file if you choose to use it.

For example, the very first simulation I created used the Space, Entity, and Simulations modules and was started like this:

addEvent(window, 'load', function () {
    AIScript('Space', 'Entities', 'Simulations', function (box) {
	// Space, Entity, and Simulations are included in the box object
        this.simulate(new Simulation());
        this.start();
    });
});

This is commonly referred to as sandboxing. You can re-init, restart, and pause a simulation at anytime from within the Simulations module. You also have access to the rendering context at all times through the pInst object of the main script. However, the rendering context is passed to every simulations Draw method for convenience.

Calling simulate() on another simulation while a simulation is in progress will cause a transition firing exit and enter methods on the simulation(s).

Notes
------------------

This project is a work in progress and some commit pushes may even break its functionality completely! 

Samples of simulations running inside this framework will occasionally appear on my site at: joshbyrom.com
