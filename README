AIScript
====================================

I created this project to act as a framework to easily implement my projects using JavaScript.

Scene Graph
------------------

My projects will be using the processing.js library for rendering. More info can be found at: http://processingjs.org/


Information & Usage
------------------

Samples of how to use this project and descriptions of the objects are coming soon!


External Resources Required
------------------

You page will need to include the modules you will be using from the AIScript library as well as the processing.js file.


Notes
------------------

This project is a work in progress and some commit pushes may even break its functionality completely! 

Samples of simulations running inside this framework will occasionally appear on my site at: joshbyrom.com
